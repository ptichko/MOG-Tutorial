A tutorial using the R library Mixtools to model infants' statistical learning of speech sound categories. The statistical model is a MOG whose parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm. First, a model is introduced to estimate parameters of VOT distrbutions for voiced/voiceless speech sounds using EM. Then, a hypothesis testing approach is introduced to determine the number of components/categories. The model is loosely based off of McMurray et al. (2009), Developmental Science, and Kuhl et al. (1997).
